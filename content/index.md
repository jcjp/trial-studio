# September 06, 2025 - My First Page

September 07, 2025: Here is some content. (Initial content from the Nuxt studio example) Content page was not showing up properly I had to do another investigate and look into the documentation and there I saw that the content must be on the `root` not inside the `app` folder. This should now be working and you will be able to see this message. I plan to make this my timeline of activities that I want to store purely text.
