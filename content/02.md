I am not going to write any blogs here this is just my notes. H1 and H2 are too large for my test I have examples below here I use H3 which is not too big but gives emphasis.

~~I don't know why but my card has some extra space at the top?~~ _<-- It's the default margin for headings, gets bigger for different headings_
