# Nuxt minimal starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a barebones project that just followed the installation steps from Nuxt content using Nuxt CLI. This is to explore and check my hypothesis on an issue with Nuxt studio and investigate what could possibly be the solution. There are 2 problems that I am investigating:
>
> 1. There is a misconfiguration with the setup
> 2. There is a major issue with SQLite3

> [!CAUTION]
> This is currently deployed using Nuxt hub and is using Cloudflare pages as the target deployment environment. When running locally it will not be able to show `__preview.json` and will you will be unable to hit any server endpoints.
>
> To test those feature you need to run this using it's default target environment `node-server` but this will not let you `?preview=true` the pages this will only worked on deployed site.

Nothing else follows.
