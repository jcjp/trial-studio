# Nuxt Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a barebones project that just followed the installation steps from Nuxt content using Nuxt CLI. This is to explore and check my hypothesis on an issue with Nuxt studio and investigate what could possibly be the solution. There are 2 problems that I am investigating:
>
> 1. There is a misconfiguration with the setup
> 2. There is a major issue with SQLite3

Nothing else follows.
